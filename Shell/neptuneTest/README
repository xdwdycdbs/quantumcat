./ndb.sh jobid (r)
This script is to make test the product easy because I need check the data of the database continuously.
If add parameter 'r',the script would execute stored procedure restore_retry with the jobid.

./ana 
This script is to analyse the logs and its function is the same as Python/logAnalyser/ana.py
